# About project 
For this project I used dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset). 
Banks gather a bunch of data about loans to make smart choices and manage risks. They look at things like your age, marital status, job, income, debts, and credit history. They also note details about the loan itself, like how much you want to borrow, the interest rate, and how long you have to pay it back.

## Dataset description
The dataset is enormous & consists of multiple deteministic factors like borrowe's income, gender, loan pupose etc.
