# About project 
For this project I used dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset). 
Banks gather a bunch of data about loans to make smart choices and manage risks. They look at things like your age, marital status, job, income, debts, and credit history. They also note details about the loan itself, like how much you want to borrow, the interest rate, and how long you have to pay it back.

 1. Data Exploration: Examined the basic properties of the dataset and its distribution.
 2. Statistical Analysis: Calculated key descriptive statistics for loan amounts and incomes.
 3. Statistical Testing: Assessed the significance of differences between means and medians, and analyzed correlations between variables.

The analysis results provided insights into the data structure, revealed significant differences in distributions, and highlighted correlations between the examined features.
